# Console-Finances

## Description

I used JavaScript code to analyze the financial records of a company.
The code was used to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  - You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  - (`Total/Number of months`)

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Here is the screenshot of the analysis

The final code prints the analysis to the console.
